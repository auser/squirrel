Squirrel
---

A lightweight queuing library in erlang. 

    make
    erl -pa ./ebin/ -eval 'application:start(squirrel)'

To demonstrate functionality:

    squirrel:subscribe(ari, fun(Msg) -> io:format("Msg: ~p~n", [Msg]) end).
    squirrel:publish(ari, {hello, dog}).

Features
----------

Limited. This is only a lightweight queue with very little functionality. If you need something more, I highly suggest RabbitMQ.
